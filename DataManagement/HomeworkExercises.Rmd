## Data management

['HomeworkExerciseExcel'](https://github.com/PeterAlspach/Ecuador/blob/master/DataManagement/HomeworkExerciseExcel.xls) is an Excel worksheet with some data.  Re-organise this so that it adheres to the [best practices](https://github.com/PeterAlspach/Ecuador/blob/master/DataManagement/DataManagementUsingSpreadsheets.html) outlined during the workshop.  Where there is insufficient information, provide a space and indicate that the information is missing.
