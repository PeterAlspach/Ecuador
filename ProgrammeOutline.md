### Proposed programme outline

#### An introductory workshop on R:
* Getting data in
* Basic data-checking and summarising
* Elements of graphics

#### Data management using Spreadsheets:
* The data-cycle
* Meta-data
* Data sheets
* Elementary processing
* Using templates

#### Design of field experiments:
* Principles of experimental design
* DiGGer, a tool for designing experiments

#### Statistics for plant breeders:
More advanced R with particular relevance to plant breeders

The plan is to run two 2-day works at each of two sites (Quito and the coast), and perhaps an abbreviated version in the Amazon.

Two key themes of the workshops will be 'reproducible research'and Ã§ollaboration'.  As part of this, all workshop notes will be made available on github

At the end of the workshops, participants should be:
* Familiar with the importance of reproducible research
* Understand the importance of managing data well
* Be able to explore data using R and Excel
* Understand what makes a good scientific graph
* Appreciate the importance of good experimental design and be able to use DiGGer to create such designs

I hope there will also be an opportunity to talk to some participants about their particular data issues.
