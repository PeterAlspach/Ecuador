Why is trial design important?
========================================================

* The purpose of an experiment is to identify important effects and estimate their size (i.e., it is not simply hypothesis testing)
* Essential for valid results
* Good trial design can
    + Lead to readily interpretable results
    + Reduce the chance of erroneous or spurious results
    + Increase efficiency
    + Improve data quality
    + Improve ability to use historical data
    + Reduce wastage
    + Enhance reproducibility

What to consider?
========================================================

* Type I and type II errors.  That is, one wants to
    + Avoid detection of non-existence (or unimportant) effects
    + Detect an effect that is actually present
* Cost (Is the experiment as proposed affordable?  Is there a good cost-benefit ratio?)
* Practicality (Can the experiment actually be done as designed?  Is it so complicated that the chance of making a mistake is unacceptably high?)
* What to measure
* How will the data be captured, stored and analysed?
* Is the trial intended to establish [equivalence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019319/) (at some acceptable level) or difference?

An Applied Statistician's Creed
========================================================
Nester, MR (1996) Applied Statistics 45(4):401-410

* __Treatments__: all treatments differ
* __Factors__: all factors interact
* __Correlations__: all variables are correlated
* __Populations__: no two populations are the same in any respect
* __Normality__: no data are normally distributed
* __Variances__: variances are never equal
* __Models__: all models are wrong
* __Equality__: no two numbers are the same
* __Size__: many numbers are very small

Randomise and Replicate
=========================================================

* Randomisation gives the experiment validity
* Replication gives it power
* Randomisation must be at the level of the experimental unit
* Can the results be generalised?
* Is the experiment testing relevant treatments (e.g., stage in breeding trials with densely planted trees of different genotypes, and hence P&D susceptibilty, _versus_ commerical situation with wider spacing all of the same level of P&D tolerance/resistances, perhaps grown on rootstocks)

"Common" Designs
==========================================================
* Completely randomised design (CRD)
* Randomised complete block (RCB)
* Row-column designs (e.g., Latin Square)
* Split-plot designs
* Balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD)
    + Can be resolvable
* Partially replicated (P-rep) designs
* Designs with uneven replication
* Two-stage designs
* Multi-environment trials
